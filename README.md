# FYP_Project_ZouJiaJun

## Description: ##
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the Final Year Project (FYP) titled "Exploring Facial Recognition: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models". The reason for carrying out this project is to investigate and evaluate the performance of various machine learning and deep learning models in detecting faces.

## Contents: ##
<b>Code:</b> The code directory includes the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used to build machine learning and deep learning models, train them on face recognition datasets, and evaluate their performance.

<b>Data:</b> The data directory contains the datasets used to train and test the models. This might comprise images of faces labelled with their unique identities or attributes.

<b>Results:</b> This category includes the output of the project's experiments, such as accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and visualisations.
